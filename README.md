### Project overview
This project aims to consolidate and display the trends in the effect of fishing activities on stock levels in various waterbodies around the world over the years through visualizaton. By summarizing and visualizing the metrics of stcock levels, we seek to make it easy to read and interpret the trends and make data driven recommendations.

### Data Source
The primary data for this project is the "Fishstock-within-sustainable-levels" excel file within the "Fish and fishing" dataset. The data includes information about fishstock within biologically sustainable levels and those stocks which have been overexploited between the years 1974 to 2017.
### Tools
 - Microsoft Excel [Download here](https:microsoft.com)
### Data preparation
In the initial preparation, we performed the following tasks:
 1. Data loading and inspection for any missing values
 2. Data formatting
 ### Exploratory Data Analysis
 EDA was done to explore the fishing data to answer the below key questions:
 - What is the overall trend in stock levels?
 - What are the top five regions where overexploitation has been reported?
 - In which years were the highest sustainable levels and peak overexploitation reported?
### Data Analysis
Data was summarized in an interactive way using MsExcel Pivot tables to see patterns, comparisons and trends in the data. This was then visualized in an interactive dashboard.

### Findings
The results of this project are summarized as follows:
1. The fish stock sustainable levels have been steadily decreasing over the years, while consequently overexplotation has been increasing
2. Year 1974 recorded the highest sustainable levels while 2017 recorded the lowest sustainable levels
3. The Western Central Atlantic, Eastern Central Atlantic, Northwest Central Atlantic, Southwest Atlantic, Southeast Pacific, Mediterranean and Black Sea were the top 5 overexpolited regions in  ascending order respectively.
### Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, we recommend the following actions
1. Promote sustainable fishing activities such as seacsonal closures during breeding periods
2. Enhance monitoring and surveillance to track fishing activities in these waterbodies
3. Develop sustainable aquaculture development to reduce pressures on wild stocks
